# my .emacs.d

Inappropriately closely inspired by [rubbish](https://github.com/rubbish/rubbish-emacs-setup).

Here are a few common packages that you might need (you might need others):
* `apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev`
* `apt-get install libXpm-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev`
* `apt-get install libncurses-dev`
* `apt-get install texinfo git subversion cvs`
* for ruby, `gem install rake`
* for json-validate, install [trentm json](https://github.com/trentm/json)

And then:
* install [emacs 24.1](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), `./configure`, `make`, `sudo make install` or download using your favorite package manager
* clone this repo to `$HOME/.emacs.d`
* run emacs
